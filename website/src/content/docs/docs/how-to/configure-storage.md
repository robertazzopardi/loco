Goal: give your app a place to put uploaded files — on disk, in memory (for tests), or in a cloud bucket — through one consistent `Storage` API, without hand-rolling an OpenDAL client yourself.

Loco's storage layer is a thin abstraction over [Apache OpenDAL](https://opendal.apache.org/). Every driver ends up implementing the same `StoreDriver` trait, so your controller code doesn't change when you swap local disk for S3.

## Prerequisites

Local, in-memory, and null storage work with no extra Cargo features. Cloud drivers need one of:

```toml
loco-rs = { version = "...", features = ["storage_aws_s3"] } # or storage_azure, storage_gcp, all_storage
```

See the [feature flags reference](/docs/reference/feature-flags) for the full matrix.

## 1. Configure a single driver

The common case — one store for the whole app — is set in YAML, the same way `database`/`cache`/`queue` are. See the [`storage` reference](/docs/reference/configuration#storage) for the full key list per driver.

```yaml
# config/development.yaml
storage:
  kind: Local
  path: storage/uploads
```

```yaml
# config/production.yaml
storage:
  kind: Aws
  bucket: my-app-uploads
  region: us-east-1
  access_key_id: <%= get_env(name="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID") %>
  secret_access_key: <%= get_env(name="AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY") %>
```

No `storage:` key at all → Loco defaults to the **`Null` driver** — every storage operation returns `StorageError::Any("Operation not supported by null storage")`. That's a deliberate fail-fast default, not a bug: it means "you haven't wired storage yet." Both the config-driven default and the no-config fallback land on `ctx.storage: Arc<Storage>`.

## 2. Or wire it in code (still supported)

For anything the config's per-driver field set doesn't cover — custom credential resolution, a driver Loco doesn't ship — set `ctx.storage` yourself in the `after_context` hook (`src/app.rs`). This runs *after* the config-driven store above is built, so it always wins:

```rust
use loco_rs::storage::{self, drivers};

async fn after_context(ctx: AppContext) -> Result<AppContext> {
    Ok(ctx
        .into_builder()
        .storage(storage::Storage::single(drivers::local::new()).into())
        .build())
}
```

`AppContext` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so `AppContext { storage, ..ctx }` won't compile in your app — that's what keeps a new field in a future Loco release from breaking your build. `into_builder()` is the replacement: it carries every component the boot sequence already attached (mailer, queue, cache, shared store) across, and you override just the one you care about. Building from `AppContext::builder(..)` instead would compile and silently drop the rest.

## 3. Pick a driver

Every driver is built by a plain constructor function under `loco_rs::storage::drivers::*` — no trait object wrangling required.

| Driver | Feature | Constructor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local filesystem | none | `drivers::local::new()` — rooted at the current working directory<br>`drivers::local::new_with_prefix(prefix) -> StorageResult<Box<dyn StoreDriver>>` | `new_with_prefix` errors if the prefix path doesn't exist |
| In-memory | none | `drivers::mem::new()` | Good for tests; data doesn't survive process exit |
| Null | none | `drivers::null::new()` | The framework default; every op errors |
| AWS S3 | `storage_aws_s3` | `drivers::aws::new(bucket, region) -> StorageResult<...>`<br>`drivers::aws::with_credentials(bucket, region, cred) -> StorageResult<...>`<br>`drivers::aws::with_credentials_and_endpoint(bucket, region, endpoint, cred) -> StorageResult<...>` | `Credential { key_id, secret_key, token: Option<String> }` |
| Azure Blob | `storage_azure` | `drivers::azure::new(container, account_name, access_key, endpoint) -> StorageResult<...>` | |
| Google Cloud Storage | `storage_gcp` | `drivers::gcp::new(bucket, credential_path) -> StorageResult<...>` | `credential_path` points to a service-account JSON key file |

All the cloud constructors return `StorageResult<Box<dyn StoreDriver>>` (they can fail to build the underlying OpenDAL operator), so propagate the error with `?`:

```rust
use loco_rs::storage::{self, drivers};

async fn after_context(ctx: AppContext) -> Result<AppContext> {
    let store = drivers::aws::new("my-app-uploads", "us-east-1")?;
    Ok(ctx
        .into_builder()
        .storage(storage::Storage::single(store).into())
        .build())
}
```

For credentials that aren't in the environment/instance profile, pass them explicitly:

```rust
use loco_rs::storage::drivers::aws::{self, Credential};

let credential = Credential {
    key_id: std::env::var("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")?,
    secret_key: std::env::var("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")?,
    token: None,
};
let store = aws::with_credentials("my-app-uploads", "us-east-1", credential)?;
```

> The storage driver trait is `StoreDriver` (not `StorageDriver`) — you'll see it in error messages and if you implement your own driver.

## 4. Use multiple named stores with a strategy (optional)

For a second store alongside the default one — a mirror/backup pair for redundancy, or just an extra bucket you pull from — configure it under `initializers.storage` and register `MultiStorageInitializer`. This never touches `ctx.storage`: the default store from [§1](#1-configure-a-single-driver) (or an `after_context` override) is untouched, and the multi-store `Storage` shows up as a router `Extension`, extracted like any other:

```yaml
# config/development.yaml
initializers:
  storage:
    stores:
      primary: { kind: Aws, bucket: my-app-uploads, region: us-east-1 }
      mirror: { kind: Azure, container: my-container, account_name: my-account, access_key: <%= get_env(name="AZURE_STORAGE_KEY") %>, endpoint: https://my-account.blob.core.windows.net }
    strategy:
      kind: Mirror              # or Backup, or Single
      primary: primary
      secondaries: [mirror]
      failure_policy: { kind: FailIfAny }   # or AllowAll, AllowSingleFailure, or { kind: FailAtFailures, count: 2 }
```

```rust
async fn initializers(_ctx: &AppContext) -> Result<Vec<Box<dyn Initializer>>> {
    Ok(vec![Box::new(loco_rs::initializers::storage::MultiStorageInitializer)])
}
```

```rust
use axum::extract::Extension;
use loco_rs::storage::Storage;
use std::sync::Arc;

async fn upload_to_mirror(Extension(storage): Extension<Arc<Storage>>) -> Result<Response> {
    storage.upload(Path::new("report.pdf"), &content).await?;  // fans out to both primary and mirror
    format::empty()
}
```

`strategy.kind: Single` (with a `default` key instead of `primary`/`secondaries`) skips replication entirely — every store is still independently addressable by name, just none of them mirror or fall back to each other. That's the shape for a plain "extra bucket to pull from" — for example a public, read-only bucket alongside your primary write-store:

```yaml
initializers:
  storage:
    stores:
      primary: { kind: Local, path: storage/uploads }
      public: { kind: Aws, bucket: my-app-public-assets, region: us-east-1 }
    strategy:
      kind: Single
      default: primary
```

```rust
storage.as_store_err("public")?.download(path).await?;  // never touched by unqualified storage.download()
```

A `Storage`'s `strategy` field is a single value — it governs at most one primary/secondaries fan-out group per `MultiStorageConfig`. A store not named in `primary`/`secondaries`/`default` just sits in `stores`, reachable only via `as_store`. Two independent mirror groups in one app need two separate `initializers.storage`-shaped configs under different keys, each with its own `MultiStorageInitializer`-equivalent registration — there's no single-`Storage` shape for that, because there's no single-`Storage` *code* shape for that either.

### Or build it in code (still supported)

Everything above is `storage::create_multi_storage_provider` reading YAML. For anything the config doesn't cover, build the `Storage` yourself the same way you always could:

```rust
use std::collections::BTreeMap;
use loco_rs::storage::{
    drivers, Storage,
    strategies::{replicated::{ReplicatedStrategy, FailurePolicy}, StorageStrategy},
};

let primary = drivers::aws::new("bucket-primary", "us-east-1")?;
let mirror = drivers::azure::new("container", "account", "access-key", "https://account.blob.core.windows.net")?;

let strategy: Box<dyn StorageStrategy> = Box::new(ReplicatedStrategy::mirror(
    "primary",
    Some(vec!["mirror".to_string()]),
    FailurePolicy::FailIfAny, // or AllowAll
));

let storage = Storage::new(
    BTreeMap::from([
        ("primary".to_string(), primary),
        ("mirror".to_string(), mirror),
    ]),
    strategy,
);
```

`FailurePolicy::FailIfAny` requires every secondary to succeed (errors bubble up as `StorageError::Multi`); `AllowAll` swallows secondary failures; `AllowSingleFailure`/`FailAtFailures { count: n }` sit between the two. `ReplicatedStrategy::backup(..)` builds the non-mirroring variant — writes still fan out, but reads always come from the primary only. It exposes a `_with_policy`/`_with_strategy` variant on every `Storage` method (`upload_with_strategy`, `download_with_policy`, ...) if you need to override the strategy for a single call.

## 5. Upload and download in a controller

```rust
use loco_rs::prelude::*;
use std::path::PathBuf;

async fn upload_file(
    State(ctx): State<AppContext>,
    mut multipart: Multipart,
) -> Result<Response> {
    while let Some(field) = multipart.next_field().await.map_err(|_| {
        Error::BadRequest("could not read multipart".into())
    })? {
        let file_name = field
            .file_name()
            .map(str::to_string)
            .ok_or_else(|| Error::BadRequest("file name not found".into()))?;

        let content = field
            .bytes()
            .await
            .map_err(|_| Error::BadRequest("could not read bytes".into()))?;

        let path = PathBuf::from("uploads").join(file_name);
        ctx.storage.as_ref().upload(&path, &content).await?;

        return format::json(serde_json::json!({ "path": path }));
    }
    not_found()
}
```

(Requires the `multipart` feature on the `axum` crate.)

## 6. Stream large files instead of buffering them

For files too large to comfortably hold in memory, use the streaming API — `download_stream`/`upload_stream` return/accept a `BytesStream`, which converts directly to/from an axum `Body`. This is undocumented in earlier Loco releases but is a stable, full public feature.

Streaming a download straight into an HTTP response, with zero extra buffering:

```rust
use axum::response::IntoResponse;
use std::path::Path;

async fn download_video(State(ctx): State<AppContext>) -> Result<impl IntoResponse> {
    let stream = ctx.storage.download_stream(Path::new("videos/demo.mp4")).await?;
    Ok(stream.into_body())
}
```

Streaming an upload from an incoming request body (axum's `Body` stream yields `axum::Error`, so map it to `std::io::Error` first — that's the error type `BytesStream` expects):

```rust
use loco_rs::storage::stream::BytesStream;
use futures_util::StreamExt;
use std::path::Path;

async fn upload_video(State(ctx): State<AppContext>, body: axum::body::Body) -> Result<Response> {
    let mapped = body
        .into_data_stream()
        .map(|chunk| chunk.map_err(std::io::Error::other));
    let stream = BytesStream::from_body_stream(mapped);
    ctx.storage.upload_stream(Path::new("videos/demo.mp4"), stream).await?;
    format::empty()
}
```

If you need the whole payload as one `Bytes` buffer anyway, `BytesStream::collect()` gives you that — but at that point you've given up the memory benefit of streaming.

**Strategy caveat:** streaming isn't uniformly "true streaming" once a strategy other than `SingleStrategy` is involved. `ReplicatedStrategy` unifies the former mirror/backup behavior: reads (both the buffered `download` and `download_stream`) fall back to secondaries when `read_from_secondaries` is set — i.e. constructed via `ReplicatedStrategy::mirror` — and are served from the primary only when constructed via `ReplicatedStrategy::backup`. Either way, `upload_stream` buffers the whole payload once via `collect()` and then fans out concurrently to secondaries. If you need guaranteed zero-buffering streaming to a single store, stick to `SingleStrategy` (the default).

## 7. Check existence, list, and stat

`Storage` also exposes `exists`, `list`, and `stat`, each going through the selected strategy the same way `upload`/`download` do (with `exists_with_policy`/`list_with_policy`/`stat_with_policy` siblings for overriding the strategy per call).

```rust
use std::path::Path;

// Does a key exist?
let found = ctx.storage.exists(Path::new("uploads/report.pdf")).await?;

// List everything under a prefix, recursively.
let all_entries = ctx.storage.list(Path::new("uploads"), true).await?;

// List one level deep — child prefixes come back as directory entries.
let top_level = ctx.storage.list(Path::new("uploads"), false).await?;

// Metadata for a single key, without downloading its content.
let meta = ctx.storage.stat(Path::new("uploads/report.pdf")).await?;
println!("{} bytes, is_dir={}", meta.content_length.unwrap_or(0), meta.is_dir);
```

Each entry returned by `list`/`stat` is a `storage::drivers::ListEntry` (prefer `ListEntry::new(...)` over struct literals).

On `ReplicatedStrategy` (mirror / `read_from_secondaries`):

- `stat` falls back to secondaries on primary error (same as `download`)
- `exists` falls back when the primary reports `false` **or** errors (a miss is not itself an error)
- `list` falls back when the primary errors **or** returns an empty listing; empty secondaries are skipped so a later secondary with data still wins

Backup mode (`read_from_secondaries: false`) keeps all three primary-only.

## 8. Presign direct uploads and downloads

`Storage` exposes `presign_get` and `presign_put` for handing clients a
time-limited URL that talks to the backing store directly (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
without proxying bytes through your app.

```rust
use std::{path::Path, time::Duration};
use loco_rs::storage::drivers::PresignPutOptions;

let ttl = Duration::from_secs(300);

let download = ctx.storage.presign_get(Path::new("exports/checkpoint.bin"), ttl).await?;
println!("GET {}", download.url());

let upload = ctx
    .storage
    .presign_put(
        Path::new("uploads/report.pdf"),
        ttl,
        PresignPutOptions {
            content_type: Some("application/pdf".to_string()),
            ..Default::default()
        },
    )
    .await?;
println!("{} {}", upload.method, upload.url());
```

Each call returns a `storage::drivers::PresignedRequest` with `method`, `uri`,
`headers`, and a `url()` helper. Clients must send the signed headers exactly
as returned.

On `ReplicatedStrategy`, presign is **primary-only** — presigned URLs are tied
to one backend's credentials and never fall back to secondaries.

To exercise presign against a real S3-compatible endpoint in tests (ignored in
normal CI; set the env vars and pass `-- --ignored`):

```sh
LOCO_TEST_S3_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:9000 \
LOCO_TEST_S3_BUCKET=loco-presign-test \
LOCO_TEST_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minio \
LOCO_TEST_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minio123 \
cargo test -p loco-rs presign_s3_roundtrip --features storage_aws_s3 -- --ignored
```

## 9. Verify

```rust
use axum_test::multipart::{MultipartForm, Part}; // not re-exported by the testing prelude
use loco_rs::testing::prelude::*;

#[tokio::test]
#[serial]
async fn can_upload_and_download() {
    request::<App, _, _>(|request, ctx| async move {
        let file_content = "loco file upload";
        let file_part = Part::bytes(file_content.as_bytes()).file_name("loco.txt");
        let multipart_form = MultipartForm::new().add_part("file", file_part);

        let response = request.post("/upload/file").multipart(multipart_form).await;
        response.assert_status_ok();

        let res: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(&response.text()).unwrap();
        let path = res["path"].as_str().unwrap();

        let stored: String = ctx.storage.as_ref().download(&std::path::Path::new(path)).await.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(stored, file_content);
    })
    .await;
}
```
